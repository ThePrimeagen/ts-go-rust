## NOTE TO THE COURSE WATCHERS
I am writing this to you because there is going to be some things you need to
know.  First off, i move pretty fast so the complete code is available at
[Here](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ts-go-rust-projector).

# BEFORE YOU READ THE CODE
A very important note about the code.  It does contain the surprise at the end
of the course that will help you understand rust's borrow checker.  So I would
be careful just rushing in and checking out the code.  As there will be a
slight difference in the code online due to a last minute refactoring.

## So why 3 languages
The chance is that you want to learn rust or go and simple language tutorials
just don't cut it for you.

## There are going to be questions
I will provide stopping points, fequently, along the way.

Work at a small dvd shipping company.  I think we will revolutionize the
industry.

## The Pace
We have a couple days.  There is a lot of programming to do.  So its going to
be fast.  Really fast.  And if you want to move as fast as I do, you can always
check out these courses.

## Google is your friend, sometimes
One more tip.  If I forget something today and have to google, you will see me
try a few times first without googling.  Why?
