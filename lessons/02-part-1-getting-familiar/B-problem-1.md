## Advent of Code
So every year on December 1st an advent calendar of the most nerdiest type is
created for us to enjoy the winter time in style.  This, of course, is Advent
of Code.  Its a series of festive problem solving inloving Santa in an unusual
pickle where his quick wits and problem solving skills helps him navigate his
way through the world and ultimately save Christmas.

### For me
This is one of the best ways to learn a language.  Simple and small problems
that are accomplishable.

## Problem 1 : Submarine navigation
Without all the fluff and festive fun of advent of code here is th deets.

<br />

1.  Your submarine starts at position 0,0 (x position, depth)
1.  Parse input to direct your submarine.
1.  Multiply your depth * x progression to get an answer

<br />

Example input
```
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
```

<br />

#### Note
this means that up 3 is actually -3 from the y axis.

## Typescript
Very easy.  I am going to intentionally over program it, to make it simple and
to hopefully show some things that are weird in other languages.

## Golang
this should feel surprisingly easy.
